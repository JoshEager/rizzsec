Rizzsec is a program that can be used for a simple substitution Cipher. To use the program, you should first specify what mode you want to run the program in. If you would like to encrypt a text file, you should type ./rizzsec encrypt, and if you want to decrypt a file you should type decrypt instead. The next thing that you need is -d <path_to_input_file>, which is the file that you would like to perform an operation on (either encrypt or decrypt). You will also need to specify a key to use, which you should do wiht -i <path_to_key>. If you would like to control the name of the output file, you should type -o <name of file>.
